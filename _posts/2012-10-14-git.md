Environment
-----------
Work development environment is Windows, which means I interact with git using powershell and [msysgit](http://msysgit.github.com/)  
Can use [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)  


Powershell profile
------------------
See ??PENDING??  


Windows remote bare repositories
--------------------------------
This is based on [kozmic's content](http://kozmic.pl/2011/08/20/simple-guide-to-running-git-server-on-windows-in-local-network-kind-of/)  
Created a shared directory on a file server, giving domain users modify permissions  
To create the bare repository on the file server run - git init --bare //fileserver/scm/myrepo.git  
To clone this repository on a workstation run - git clone //fileserver/scm/myrepo.git  


SSH
---
See  
[Working with ssh key passphrases](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases) on github  
[git windows setup](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/) on github  
[posh git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) powershell module (GitUtils.ps1 file)  

Generate key using ssh-keygen  
 `ssh-keygen`  
Ensure ssh-agent is on path and not already running
 `ssh-agent | ? { $_ -match '(?<key>[^=]+)=(?<value>[^;]+);' | % { $key = $matches['key']; $value =$matches['value']; set-item env:$key $value; } }`  
 `if (test-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa) { ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa; }`  
 `# To verify above can use the following`  
 `ssh-add -l 			# to see added identities`  
 `ssh -v git@github.com 	# to test`  


Hooks
-----
See [hooks](http://pmcgrath.github.com/git-hooks/)


Powershell script to watch file usage when interacting with git
---------------------------------------------------------------
Tried to run Tim Berglund's bash script, but since [msysgit](http://msysgit.github.com/) currently comes with a very old version of bash it did not work, so just used powershell equivalent  
Obviously you can only really watch a small repo, if you want to be able to see all the files  
Probably a good idea to remove all the sample hooks in the .git/hooks directory  
Open two terminals side by side, running the below script from within the .git directory of the repository you want to observe  
`for(;;) { clear; tree /F; sleep 1; }`  


Good presentations
------------------
[Jessica Kerr](http://vimeo.com/46010208) explains git using a whiteboard  
[Tim Berglund](http://vimeo.com/49478285) explains git internals in short video, really good content
