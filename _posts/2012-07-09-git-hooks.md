commit-msg hook
---------------
This sample commit-msg hook will check that local commits (excluding merge commits) have a commit message that starts with a very specific pattern, here it checks that every commit's commit message starts with a feature identifier.

This check will apply to commits on all branches, so it may be too restrictive for experimental branches, could alter to only apply to the master branch

update hook
---------------
This sample update hook which should be deployed within the bare remote repository will check that pushes commits (excluding merge commits) have a commit message that starts with a very specific pattern, here it checks that every commit's commit message starts with a feature identifier.

This check will be applied to all branches, not just the master branch, so if pushing experimental branches this may be a bit restrictive
